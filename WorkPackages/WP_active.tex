\begin{wpdescription}
In equilibrium, information about the macroscopic state of a medium can be deduced via
rather simple measurement procedures using simple probes and then be summarized in an
equation of state.
%
In the future, something similar may become possible even far from equilibrium, and
revolutionize our technological abilities, but this will require much more sophisticated
probing and analyzing procedures that are not yet generally understood.
%
Far from equilibrium, fluctuations are non-universal and standard thermodynamic notions,
such as temperature and pressure, become ambiguous.
%
This has many unintuitive practical consequences, which defy conventional thermodynamic
wisdom and potentially invalidate and doom to failure well-established standard
technological procedures.

For example, a colloidal particle in a non-isothermal solvent cannot be used for Brownian thermometry 
in the conventional way \cite{rings-etal:2010,kroy:2014}, and also the proper theoretical 
treatment of its systematic, thermophoretic propulsion is the subject of ongoing debates.
%
We have recently shown how to overcome some of these limitations in terms of a frequency-dependent noise 
temperature \cite{falasco-etal:2014}.
%
We want to validate this result experimentally and to see to what extent something similar be achieved for other 
nonequilibria, particularly in active-particle suspensions.

Further, far from equilibrium, the mechanical pressure on a mesoscopic probe will generally depend on the range and 
symmetry of the medium-probe interactions: if an active-particle suspension is compressed, the
amount of work needed may depend on the surface properties of the piston, and it can be macroscopically
anisotropic and heterogeneous in absence of stationary fluxes. 
%
We want to elucidate this within a many-body theory of ``dry active matter'' \cite{marchetti-etal:2013}, 
to which we successively add elements of ``wet reality'' \cite{zoettl-stark:2014}.

Similarly, motile proteins and motors in a living cell cause deviations of the function
of its constituents with respect to conventional equilibrium predictions.  We call this
effect ``active crowding'', in analogy with the much studied ``molecular crowding''. 
%
Any biopolymer in a living cell actually represents a ``smart'' probe that scans its environment with its many 
internal degrees of freedom \cite{otto-etal:2013}.
%
We could recently demonstrate by theory and simulations that the effect of a quenched static crowding onto an embedded
polymer can effectively be captured by a parameter renormalization \cite{schoebl-etal:2014}.  
%
Here we ask: can something similar be achieved for active crowding?

The above fundamental issues severely limit a first-principles approach to living systems and
innovative technological applications involving active matter.
%
We address them as systematically as we can (though not comprehensively) with the above
objectives 1 \& 2 (theoretically) and 3 \& 4 (experimentally and by massively parallel
computer simulations).

\begin{tasklist}

\begin{task}[title=Non-Equilibrium Equations of State (NEOS),id=task1,PM=8,lead=ULEI,partners={UNIPD,USTUTT},
wphases=0-48!0.5]
As a paradigm for a nonequilibrium medium we consider the (experimentally vast) class of
active-particle suspensions, in collaboration with the group in Padova providing expert knowledge on 
nonequilibrium response theory.
%
Our starting point is a many-body Langevin equation with a Markovian Gaussian noise
(describing the coupling to an equilibrium heat bath) and individual propulsion forces for
the particles representing, on an all-atom-level, the active fluid far from equilibrium \cite{solon-etal:2015}. 
%
We let the fluid interact perturbatively with one large colloidal probe particle to
deduce its effective friction kernel, and with more probe particles in order to
detect their induced mutual interactions, non-gradient forces, and a possible breaking of
the action-reaction principle on the probe level.  
%
Non-equilibrium response theory lets us include frenetic contributions in the response 
functions \cite{baiesi-wynants:2009}.
%
Of special interest to us is the mechanical pressure exerted by an active fluid on a probe, 
especially if we relax geometric symmetries (tacitly) imposed in previous approaches.

To add elements of reality, we then introduce more realistic particle-probe interactions, as appropriate for the hot 
Janus particles that we sudy in our experiments and simulations.
%
To clarify how active-particle suspensions are fundamentally different from externally driven systems, 
we will search, in close collaboration with Stuttgart, the connection between our particle-based approach 
and their field theoretical approach.

\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active Crowding,id=task2,lead=ULEI,wphases=0-48!0.5]
Pioneering attempts to estimate how the activity in a living cell affects the physical behavior
of its constituents predict that it will, via hydrodynamic interactions, enhance the diffusion of
globular probes or cell organelles \cite{mikhailov-kapral:2015}.
%
Yet, it remains open, how such partial results get modified if one considers, for example, that motors or
other sources of nonequilibrium do often act directly on cytoskeletal polymers and their
weak transient networks that may get disrupted.
%
We want to  investigate how three different types of active
crowding affect the fluctuation spectrum and dynamics of a semiflexible test polymer: a
laser-heated metal nanoparticle tracer attached to a micron-sized semiflexible polymer such
as an actin microfilament; power strokes of attached molecular
motors inducing backbone tension spikes along the polymer contour; ``inelastic'' \cite{gralka-kroy:2015}
unbinding of weak bonds, which are the ubiquitous cement of
cytoskeletal structures, under static or dynamic loads.
%
This may have interesting conceptual consequences for mechanical homeostasis, i.e., how cells and tissues bear up against 
their own activity.   
%
On the technological side, it would be most useful to explore conditions for a formal mapping to the situation in 
non-isothermal liquids, via frequency-dependent noise temperatures and 
effective friction coefficients \cite{falasco-etal:2014}.
%
For these tasks we can build on our previous first-principle analytical studies
of non-linear nonequilibrium biopolymer dynamics \cite{otto-etal:2013}, non-quasistatic forcible 
bond kinetics \cite{bullerjahn-sturm-kroy:2014}, and hot Brownian motion 
\cite{rings-etal:2010,falasco-etal:2014}.

\end{task}


\begin{task}[title=Noise Temperature,id=task3,lead=ULEI,wphases=0-24!0.5]
We have recently established a tractable ``drosophila'' for the central theme of probing 
macroscopic nonequilibria in terms so-called non-isothermal (or ``hot'') Brownian motion \cite{rings-etal:2010}.
%
Its key quantity is a frequency-dependent temperature for the Brownian noise 
strength (``noise temperature'') \cite{falasco-etal:2014}.
%
Corner stones of statistical mechanics, such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, can
thereby be generalized to conditions far from equilibrium.  

To test these predictions, which are relevant to metal-nanoparticle tracking and trapping technologies and emerging
nanoscopic Brownian heat engines, beyond the easily accessible Markov limit, requires to follow the fluctuations of 
a heated Brownian particle on a nanosecond timescale with a positional accuracy of picometers and below, a task 
that has, even under conventional \emph{equilibrium} conditions, only very recently been achieved \cite{kheifets-etal:2014}.
%
A dedicated optical trap with dual beam heating and a detection bandwidth of about 50 MHz
will therefore be newly constructed. 
%
Thereby the classical method of Brownian thermometry shall be extended to media far from equilibrium.

To test the theory also by massively parallel numerical simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011}, 
we will extend the theory for hot nanoparticles in incompressible fluids 
to Lennard--Jones solvents, which exhibit a substantial compressibility.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Active-Particle Suspensions,id=task4,lead=ULEI,wphases=24-48!0.5]
Technological applications of active-particle suspensions and systematic tests of
uncontrolled approximations that are currently unavoidable in all theoretical studies are
currently severely hampered by a lack of control over these systems.
%
Therefore, dedicated experimental investigations are still very rare and some of their
results might be specific to the experimental realization of the self-propulsion mechanism.
%
We have recently established innovative force-free control systems, so-called photon nudging
and thermophoretic trapping technologies \cite{Qian2013,Braun:NanoLetters:2015}, which deliberately exploit 
the nonequilibrium transport caused by non-isothermal conditions.
%
Thereby we can e.g.\ construct soft walls for passive or active particles that act as
semi-permeable membranes.
%
Our experiments and accompanying "all-atom" Lennard--Jones molecular-dynamics simulations \cite{chakraborty-etal:2011} 
will employ hot Janus particles, which allow for a continuous tuning of the strength of 
the activity in space and time, to target 
possible failures of the description by a thermodynamic bulk-pressure equation of
state \cite{ginot-etal:2015} due to wall interactions and ensuing "ratcheting" effects.
