  The objectives of this WP are:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Exploiting the possible negative response to compression of systems holding a heat flow in the design of meta-materials.
  \item Applying effective fluctuation-response relations to large nonequilibria to make possible fast and efficient upscaling to industrial processes.
  \item Exhibiting novel architectures of polymers and membranes under flowing conditions.

\begin{wpdescription}

Monitoring the volume of a system in equilibrium represents a standard procedure for assessing its state 
variables (pressure, temperature, etc).
The situation is less clear far from equilibrium: 
how should we characterize the response to compression of a gas maintained between two temperatures?
It is not trivial to predict by common sense the behavior of systems under nonequilibrium conditions. 
One would naively expect a reduction of the volume by increasing the external compression, but there are already 
several examples of anomalous, or negative, response in nonequilibrium systems.
We have in mind instances of negative differential mobility, occurring when a particle starts to drift 
slower by increasing the external drive.

An important class of systems for which we need to understand the nonequilibrium response is that of solids 
in a temperature gradient. Examples include strongly
heated micro-cantilevers [AGBB15] and high-quality table-top oscillators of gravitational wave detectors [Cet15].
In fact, compressibility of solids in a temperature gradient is a quite unexplored subject.
In this WP we plan to fill this gap.
We aim at  understanding how the response to compression takes place and how it
may be predicted by just knowing suitable (unperturbed) steady-state correlations.
This understanding is important for a second, main stage of this WP, as explained next.


The possibility to extract energy from an installed heat channel is the mechanism that we want to
analyze, to see if it can lead to the behaviour of negative differential compressibility,
i.e.~the system expands when compressed. 
Nonequilibrium response may be written as an entropic term minus a frenetic one [BMW09].
In our case the former is the correlation between the size of the system and the entropy produced by the compression.
The frenetic term is another correlation between size and dynamical aspects that can be monitored numerically.
This scheme thus furnishes us with a guideline to assess whether simulations of a specific material are yielding data 
going in the direction of negative compressibility. In particular, since typically the entropic term is positive, we
are encouraged to privilege the development of models that show a large frenetic term, so that its subtraction from
the entropic one gives a total negative response.
We have in this way delineated a guided trial-and-error strategy, in which the notions of 
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics help us in faster developments of numerical studies. This is expected to
speed up the research if compared to a blind trial-and-error strategy.


We can consider this WP as a high reward research plan. Indeed, relevant technological applications
may be boosted by a successful achievement in finding models of materials that have negative compressibility.
Metamaterials are nowadays much studied [NM12,CG15] because, for example, artificial muscles, 
next-generation pressure sensors, and micro-actuators would be
more easily realized by using materials with a negative compressibility. We will investigate
if steady nonequilibrium conditions could produce this effect, as opposed to the recently considered 
mechanism of rearrangements from metastable states [NM12] or of enhanced expansions in orthogonal directions
due to a wine-rack structure of the materials [CG15]. Thus, the anomalous response we seek is in the direction 
of the compression and it is due to compression-enhanced extraction of energy from a heat channel,
which is prompt, excites the system expanding it, 
and does not require going through an hysteresis of the material.

    We plan to characterize the response to compression
    for models of solids experiencing a heat flow due to different boundary temperatures.
    By applying available theoretical formulations to the study of numerical simulations,
    the main aim is to make a setup for the other tasks.

    We are interested in finding if microscopic details, available of course in simulations, 
    are needed or if a more experimental-like coarse grained description is sufficient or even convenient for
    predicting the response of the system's length to an increased compression. In practice, for example,
    by running a simulation of coupled oscillators we assume that only ``macroscopic'' quantities as the system length
    are measurable and from there we try to see if a coarse-grained fluctuation-response approach is able to
    describe the behavior of the system when a compression is added.\\
    The main task of this WP is the to
        find peculiar inter-particle potentials that may lead to negative 
        compressibility in solids experiencing heat flows. 
        We plan to first operate at the conceptual level of toy models, and then to move
        at a more detailed level of realistic models, always following an effective guided
        trial-and-error strategy to develop preferentially models with large
        frenetic term in the response.

Important probes for many applications are polymers, and indeed they are often found in nonequilibrium and/or nonlinear environments.
It is very important for industrial but also for life processes what is the typical shape and the architecture of these polymers, as chemical reactivity can much depend on that.
Mechanical stresses and nonequilibrium driving in the medium can influence these geometric aspects, and it is therefore crucial to get some control of these features via nonequilibrium monitoring.
It can lead to enhanced or selective reactivity, depending on the case, but for sure the topics of the workpackage and of the project in general are extremely important for understanding them.
There will collaborations here with the groups in Leuven (also with Enrico Carlon) and with the Leipzig node.  Regular visits and exchange lectures between Leuven and Padova are already in place.
