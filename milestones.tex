\eucommentary{Milestones means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin.
They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective
measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for
example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further
development.}
