\begin{sitedescription}{TUE}

TUE is an internationally leading research university specialised in engineering science and technology. TUE is a constant presence in the top of various rankings, all acknowledging in particular the research carried out in collaboration with the industry, and currently manages more than 150 EU-funded projects. TUE offers 50 different educational programs to about 9000 students of various levels, and employs more than 3000 academic and administrative personnel.

The TUE research team in this proposal is part of both the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems. 
The Department Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) unites all activities on campus in the classical scientific disciplines of mathematics and computer science. Both research and education have recently been evaluated as excellent by international committees. 40\% of the employees at MCS are of non-Dutch origin, thus creating a truly multi-cultural environment. 

The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) is a hotbed for interdisciplinary interaction in research and education across the university. Its mission is to become the leading international multidisciplinary institute for research and education in the area of the engineering of complex molecular systems.

The joint affiliation with both the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences and the ICMS provides the TUE research team with both excellent mathematical infrastructure and broad experimental embedding.
