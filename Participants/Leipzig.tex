 Universität Leipzig was founded in 1409 and is the second oldest university in Germany where teaching has continued without interruption. 
  Today it offers a wide spectrum of academic disciplines at 14 faculties with more than 150 institutes. 
  It is a member of the German U15, a strategic alliance of 15 major German research universities. 
  The node participants are located at the Institute for Experimental Physics I and at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, respectively, which are parts of the Faculty of Physics and Earth Sciences. 
  The faculty, which enroles more than 1200 students from more than 30 countries and offers an international study program for physics, also comprises institutes for meteorology, geology, geophysics and geography. 
  It counts among the leading faculties in terms of research output and external funding, within the university, and hosts several ERC grantees. 
  It is also the first faculty of the university that recently got its research activities evaluated by an external board of international experts. 
  The physics institutes make major contributions to several collaborative research centers (SFBs) funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and to the interdisciplinary Graduate School ``Leipzig School of Natural Sciences -- Building with Molecules and Nano-objects'' (www.buildmona.de), founded by a grant from the German Excellence Initiative, which has so far enrolled close to 200 PhD candidates. 
  They maintain collaborations and joint grants with a large number of independent international and local research institutes for fundamental and applied science and industrial partners.
