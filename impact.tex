Statistical mechanics has by itself had an enormous impact on technological and economic developments in the last century.  Its framework has not only inspired the logical framework of modeling and analysing microscopics to reach mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, but it has very specifically also enabled ab initio schemes and algorithms to reach and predict macroscopic behavior.  The foundations of solid state physics and quantum field theory that have reshaped the modern world and brought major changes in dayly life are invariably consequences of the fluctuation theoretical ideas pioneered in statistical mechanics.  Yet, most if not all of that is restricted to equilibrium statistical mechanics with its powerful and general Gibbs formalism.  While that formalism and the consequenct algorithms and implementations remain a superb tool in technological research and innovation, the present project turns to nonequilibrium theory and phenomenology.  There we reach even much richer grounds, also connecting with biological systems and hence also medical applications.  The expected impact here will therefore add to the well-proven and established impact of statistical mechanics in general, while opening new avenues in the following directions:

\subsection{Measures to maximise impact}

\paragraph{a) Dissemination and exploitation of results}

\eucommentary{
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Provide a plan for disseminating and exploiting the project results. The
    plan, which should be proportionate to the scale of the project, should
    contain measures to be implemented both during and after the project.
  \item Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected
    impact of the project.
  \item Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage
    the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in
    particular addressing the following issues\footnote{For further guidance on
      research data management, please refer to the H2020 Online Manual on the
      Participant Portal.}:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item What types of data will the project generate/collect?  o What
      standards will be used?
    \item How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for
      verification and re-use?  If data cannot be made available, explain why.
    \item How will this data be curated and preserved?
    \end{compactitem}

    You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other
    things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). Where
    relevant, these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue
    market opportunities arising from the project's results.\\
%
    The appropriate structure of the consortium to support exploitation is
    addressed in section~3.3.
%
  \item Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include
    measures to provide open access (free on-line access, such as the 'green' or
    'gold' model) to peer- reviewed scientific publications which might result
    from the project.%
    \footnote{Open access must be granted to all scientific publications
      resulting from Horizon 2020 actions. Further guidance on open access is
      available in the H2020 Online Manual on the Participant Portal.}\\
%
    Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an
    article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific
    publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and
    instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the
    researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.\\
%
    Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published
    article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher
    - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside
    its publication.  Access to this article is often - but not necessarily -
    delayed ('embargo period'), as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup
    their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view
    fees during an exclusivity period.

\paragraph{b) Communication activities}

\eucommentary{
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project
    and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be
    proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives. They
    should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups
    beyond the project's own community. Where relevant, include measures for
    public/societal engagement on issues related to the project.
