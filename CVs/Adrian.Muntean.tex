\begin{participant}[type=R,PM=12,gender=male,salary=5500]{Adrian Muntean}


Adrian Muntean is lecturer at the Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Applications and the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems at TUE. His research interests lie in 
the theoretical understanding of basic interactions between large scale transport and local interactions, such as phase transitions, chemical reactions, physical/social collisions, through separated length scales ranging from discrete and stochastic systems to multiscale continua. 

With cum laude PhD student Joep Evers (2015) he has contributed to the mathematical  understanding of models for crowd evolution, including the essential interaction with hard and soft boundaries. Other objects of study are defects in non-homogeneous materials and ``swimming'' of active particles in compressible flows.

He has published more than 60 papers in peer-reviewed journals, edited two books and five special issues, supervised 10 master students and five PhD students, and organized more than 20 conferences and workshops.
