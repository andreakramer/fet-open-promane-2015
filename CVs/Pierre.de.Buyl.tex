\begin{participant}[type=R,PM=12,gender=male,salary=5500]{Pierre de Buyl}

Postdoctoral researcher at the KU Leuven.
Pierre de Buyl holds a PhD in Physics (2010) and is specialized in theoretical and
computational studies in statistical physics. He has published 15 papers in international
peer-reviewed journals and also made conference contributions. He has worked at the
Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, the University of Toronto and is now at the KUL.
%
His early work is about the consequences of long-ranged interactions on the dynamical
evolution of models relating to plasmas and gravitation.
%
His current focus is on so-called nanomotors, a class of devices that transforms a fuel into
motion for the motor (hence the name). The operation conditions are fluctuating and stronly
out of equilibrium.

In addition to his research skills, de Buyl also participates in the organization of
scientific events (web site and database for the {\em European Conference on Complex Systems
  2012}, organizer of the conferences {\em EuroSciPy 2012} and {\em EuroSciPy 2013},
webmaster for EuroSciPy since 2013 and proceedings editor in 2013 and 2014).
